        <p>Flash freezes occurring around 710 to 640 million years ago caused Earth to be entirely covered, or nearly covered, by ice. The Earth was covered for approximately 20 million years, causing temperatures to plummet. The coverage of the Earth in ice occurred twice, with both times occurring closely together. Scientists believe this event occurred due to evidence of glaciation in the warmest areas, such as the equator. Most organisms were wiped out and only a few survived in the pockets of oxygen that were trapped underneath the icy surface in the ocean.</p>

        <h1>But what caused it?</h1>

            <h3 class="text">Volcanic Eruptions</h3>
            <p class="text">Large volcanic eruptions could have possibly caused Snowball Earth due to the enormous amounts of sulfur dioxide that was released into the atmosphere. Volcanoes released sulfur dioxide into the same area since they spanned 2,000 miles across Earth's clustered up continents. The large amounts of this toxic gas clouded up the sky, preventing sunlight from reaching the Earth's surface. This caused temperatures to drastically drop and glaciers to eventually form, covering the Earth's surface to be covered in ice.</p>

        <div class="silicate">

            <h3 class="text">Silicate Weathering</h3>
            <p class="text">Silicate weathering is the breaking down of rock on Earth's surface chemically. This process needs carbon dioxide to occur. The rapid weathering of Earth's continents clustered together occurred because of the prevalence of hot and wet areas. Large amounts of carbon dioxide were drawn out of the atmosphere for this process. The decrease in this greenhouse gas prevented the Earth from being able to trap heat efficiently, thus leading to plummeting temperatures. These low temperatures increased the production of glaciers, ultimately causing the Earth to be covered in ice.</p>
