        <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
        <img src="https://www.thoughtco.com/thmb/hpio9ZgfBXdJC_gJSM-1K7-MnfQ=/768x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-1015895082-3d8690beab46443a94c63d163fc2ef5d.jpg">
        <p>Flash freezes occurring around 710 to 640 million years ago caused Earth to be entirely covered, or nearly covered, by ice. The Earth was covered for approximately 20 million years, causing temperatures to plummet. The coverage of the Earth in ice occurred twice, with both times occurring closely together. Scientists believe this event occurred due to evidence of glaciation in the warmest areas, such as the equator. Most organisms were wiped out and only a few survived in the pockets of oxygen that were trapped underneath the icy surface in the ocean.</p>

    <section id="causes">
        <h1>But what caused it?</h1>
        <div id="volcano">
            <img src="images/volcano.jpg"> 
            <h3 class="text">Volcanic Eruptions</h3>
            <p class="text">Large volcanic eruptions could have possibly caused Snowball Earth due to the enormous amounts of sulfur dioxide that was released into the atmosphere. Volcanoes released sulfur dioxide into the same area since they spanned 2,000 miles across Earth's clustered up continents. The large amounts of this toxic gas clouded up the sky, preventing sunlight from reaching the Earth's surface. This caused temperatures to drastically drop and glaciers to eventually form, covering the Earth's surface to be covered in ice.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="silicate">
            <img src="images/formula.png">
            <h3 class="text">Silicate Weathering</h3>
            <p class="text">Silicate weathering is the breaking down of rock on Earth's surface chemically. This process needs carbon dioxide to occur. The rapid weathering of Earth's continents clustered together occurred because of the prevalence of hot and wet areas. Large amounts of carbon dioxide were drawn out of the atmosphere for this process. The decrease in this greenhouse gas prevented the Earth from being able to trap heat efficiently, thus leading to plummeting temperatures. These low temperatures increased the production of glaciers, ultimately causing the Earth to be covered in ice.</p>

    </section>
    <section id="albedo">
        <h2>The Ice-Albedo Loop</h2>
        <img src="images/ice%20albedo%20feedback%20loop.png">
        <p>Albedo is the measure of how reflective an object is. Ice has a high albedo, meaning that it reflects most of the solar radiation from the sun. Water has a low albedo, meaning that it absorbs most of the solar radiation from the sun. Colder temperatures on Earth due to silicate weathering and/or volcanic eruptions led to more glaciers forming, and thus increasing the albedo. The increased albedo led to more sunlight being reflected, lowering temperatures. This continued the cycled of lower temperatures, more glaciers, and higher albedo, perpetuating the ice-albedo positive feedback loop and the coverage of Earth's surface in ice.</p>

        <h1>EVIDENCE</h1>
        <div id="ethiopia">
            <h2>Ethiopia</h2>
            <img src="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290829428/figure/fig7/AS:355864318889985@1461856073314/A-Carbonate-rich-diamictite-belonging-to-the-Ghaub-Formation-Haartbeespoort-area.png">
            <p>Scientists found diamictites, rocks formed through glacial activity. Underneath these glacial rocks, they found carbonate rocks that would’ve only formed in shallow waters. Since the carbonate rocks transitioned smoothly into diamictites, it suggested that the earth had shifted from a period of tropical climate into a frozen wasteland. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="kalahari">
            <h2>Kalahari Desert</h2>
            <img src="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stan_Halas/publication/229050373/figure/fig1/AS:300879107379200@1448746577139/A-piece-of-rock-with-the-iron-manganese-layer-from-Zasa-n-with-pointed-location-of-sample.png">
            <p>45 meter thick layer of manganese ore was found in Kalahari Desert, suggesting that its deposition was caused by the rapid melting of glaciers that carried it to where it is now. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="looking">
            <h2>Still On The Search</h2>
            <p>Scientists are still looking for more evidence of volcanic rock (dating to around 634-635 million years ago) under cap carbonate rock in different locations (other than China) in order to prove a global thawing event. So far, it has only been found in two locations in China, Yunnan and Guizhou. </p>
        </div>
    </section>
    <section id="climate">
        <h1>How does it relate to us now?</h1>
        <p>Snowball earth serves to be evidence for the earth’s tendency to undergo rapid changes in a short span of time, given the right triggers or circumstances. By contributing to the rising global temperature, our actions are pushing glaciers and ice to the point where an ice-albedo feedback loop is inevitable. The period of Snowball Earth proves to us that the results of this feedback loop will be disastrous, changing our environments to an extreme. </p>

    <section id="slushball">
        <h1>Slushball Earth</h1>
        <p>A competing hypothesis against "Snowball Earth" has been "Slushball Earth". Since Snowball Earth would be very hard to thaw, it makes more sense then that there would be open water near the equator whereas the rest of the earth remains frozen. Ocean currents would prevent the full-on freeze of the earth. </p>
